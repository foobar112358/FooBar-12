# Levels
##### Level 1: 
Given a decimal number n, return the base b in which the number n is a palindrome.  For example:

input: 10, output: 3 because (10)<sub>10</sub> = (101)<sub>3</sub> where (n)<sub>b</sub> is n base b.


##### Level 2.1: 
Given n numbers in which each number represents the number of bunnies in a cart on a train, return the max number of carts that can have the same number of bunnies by moving bunnies from one cart to the other.  For example

input: 8 12 5, output: 2 because the arragement 8 8 9 is the closest you can get to having a equal number of bunnies in each cart.

##### Level 2.2: 
Given a list of words, sort them in decending order according to the following parameters.  Words are ranked by calculating their scores as follows: if a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, and so on, a words score is the sum of the scores of its letters.  If two words have the same score (AL = 13, CJ = 13), then the lexicographically larger word is ranked higher (so CJ).  Here is an example:

input: [annie, bonnie, liz], output: [bonnie, liz, annie]
